	* Use a custom overloaded data stringification routine
	  instead of overload::StrVal().  This solves the memory
	  leak reported by Joshua Richardson <jric@yahoo-inc.com>
	  _and_ speeds up the code by about 40%! (make test timings)
	
	* Released as 1.03.

	* Null sets weren't subsets of every set in comparisons.
	  Noticed by Gerard Vreeswijk <gv@cs.uu.nl>.

	* Released as 1.02.

	* Make to work with perl 5.6.0.
	
	* Release as 1.01 as no bug reports have been seen for many moons.

	* Paul Schinder <schinder@pobox.com> reported that the set_set.t
	  subtest #5 produces "(a (b (a (c ...) ...)) (c ...))" for him,
	  not "(a (b (a ...)) (c ...))" as expected.  Nondeterminism
	  in stringification.  Not yet resolved but the test hacked
	  to allow either (for subtests #5 and #6).
	
	* Timothy Kimball <kimball@stsci.edu> reported that Set::Scalar 0.9
	  had the super/subsetness the wrong way round.  Fixed.

	* Set::Scalar 0.901 released.
