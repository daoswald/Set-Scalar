	* Add each() as a lighter weight way of iterating
	  over sets, as suggested by Dave Lewis.

	* Released as 1.12.

	* In boolean contexts the string representation of sets
	  is not the best possible one, reported by Dan Berger.
	  Now the size of the set is returned in boolean contexts.
	  
	* Released as 1.11.

	* 1.10: Added COPYRIGHT and LICENSE.

	* Annotation mixup: The fix known as 1.08 by Mark Dilger,
	  not Joy Koenig.
	 
	* Released as 1.09.

	* Set::Scalar()->new() - Set::Scalar()->new() didn't equal
	  Set::Scalar()->new(), thanks to wrong inheritance order.
	  Spotted and most graciously fixed by Joy Koenig.

	* Released as 1.08.

	* Union could end up returning a true universe, from which one
	  cannot delete elements (e.g. using difference), bug reported
	  by Malcolm Purvis.  The fix (which was applied to all of the
	  union+intersection+difference+symmetric_difference) was to
          'downgrade' results of the same size as the first argument.

	* Set::Scalar called itself Set::Scalar::Base.
	
	* Released as 1.07.

	* Make the code Perl 5.00404-proof, patch from Ed Grimm.
	
	* Released as 1.06.

Thu Jan 18 08:24:20 2001  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@alpha.hut.fi>

	* Add examples of the set differences.

	* NOTE: unique now returns a set, not a list of elements,
	  as it was documented and intended.

	* Released as 1.05.

	* unique() was rather broken, reported by Malcolm Purvis.

	* Released as 1.04.

Tue Oct 31 03:09:03 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Use a custom overloaded data stringification routine
	  instead of overload::StrVal().  This solves the memory
	  leak reported by Joshua Richardson <jric@yahoo-inc.com>
	  _and_ speeds up the code by about 40%! (make test timings)

	* Released as 1.03.

	* Null sets weren't subsets of every set in comparisons.
	  Noticed by Gerard Vreeswijk <gv@cs.uu.nl>.

	* Released as 1.02.

2000-04-15  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Make to work with perl 5.6.0.

	* Release as 1.01 as no bug reports have been seen for many moons.

1999-09-24  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Paul Schinder <schinder@pobox.com> reported that the set_set.t
	  subtest #5 produces "(a (b (a (c ...) ...)) (c ...))" for him,
	  not "(a (b (a ...)) (c ...))" as expected.  Nondeterminism
	  in stringification.  Not yet resolved but the test hacked
	  to allow either (for subtests #5 and #6).

	* Timothy Kimball <kimball@stsci.edu> reported that Set::Scalar 0.9
	  had the super/subsetness the wrong way round.  Fixed.

	* Set::Scalar 0.901 released.
